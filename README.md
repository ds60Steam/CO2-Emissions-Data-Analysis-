# CO2 Emissions Data Analysis
Aim of the Project: To analyze global CO2 emissions, identifying trends across regions and sectors. It focuses on understanding the link between CO2 emissions, economic output, population growth, and energy efficiency.
- Emissions by Region and Sector: Breaks down CO2 emissions by geographic regions and economic sectors (e.g., transportation, industry, energy production).
- Yearly Trends: Tracks how emissions have evolved over time, showing increases or reductions year over year.
- Comparative Analysis: Allows comparison between regions or industries to identify leaders and laggards in emission reductions.
- Impact Analysis: Explores the impact of specific policies, regulations, or technologies on CO2 emissions.
- Interactive Visualizations: Users can filter by time periods, countries, and sectors to gain tailored insights.
